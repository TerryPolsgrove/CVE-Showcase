# CVE-Showcase

Description:

The "CVE Showcase" is a web application that provides a user-friendly interface to display information about the latest Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). CVEs are identified security vulnerabilities in software and hardware that can pose risks to organizations and individuals. This project utilizes data from the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database, making it a valuable resource for staying informed about the most recent security threats.

Features:

Newest CVEs: The application fetches the latest CVEs, including their CVE-ID, description, publication date, and last modified date.

Clickable References: CVEs often include references to external sources for further information. The application makes these references clickable, allowing users to explore additional details about each CVE.

Technology Stack:

Python: The application is built using Python, specifically the Flask web framework for the backend.

Web Development: HTML, CSS, and Flask templates are used for creating the web interface.

API Integration: The application fetches data from the CVE database using a public API.

Purpose:

The "CVE Showcase" project aims to provide a convenient way for cybersecurity professionals, developers, and anyone interested in IT security to access and explore the latest CVEs. By making this information easily accessible and readable, the project contributes to improving awareness and proactive measures to address security vulnerabilities.

Usage:

Users can visit the web application to view the ten most recent CVEs, access their descriptions, publication dates, and references, and click on references to access additional information related to each CVE.

Future Enhancements:

In the future, the project can be expanded to include search and filtering capabilities, user authentication, and personalized notifications to keep users informed about specific CVEs of interest.

Contributions:

This project is open to contributions and improvements from the open-source community to enhance its features and usability.
